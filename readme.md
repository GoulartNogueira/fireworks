# ðŸŽ† Fireworks

You can check it online at: https://goulartnogueira.github.io/fireworks

### Motivation:
1. My TV's screensaver has a fireworks particle animation, but it sucks.
2. I'm playing with Javascript and Github Copilot, just for fun

So I decides to make my own fireworks screensaver, with more a realistic physics, including:
- gravity
- friction
- fading
- LOTS of randomicity
- scattering distribution according to 3D spheres
